# 1. Getting Started

- https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/getting-started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

## Folder structure

- `/app`: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- `/app/lib`: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- `/app/ui`: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- `/public`: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- `/scripts`: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

## Placeholder data

When you're building user interfaces, it helps to have some placeholder data. If a database or API is not yet available, you can:

- Use placeholder data in JSON format or as JavaScript objects.
- Use a 3rd party service like [mockAPI](https://mockapi.io/).
